## Motivation: 
Being a trivia buff, I wanted to create a trivia app that was simple, challenging, and entertaining. 
	
## Description:
The user has to answer ten questions from random categories with random difficulty.  The user is given multiple choice of four options or True/False to answer a question and at the end of the ten questions, the user is given a score.  The questions and answers are retrieved from the open trivia database API.
